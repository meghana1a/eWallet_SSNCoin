# eWallet_SSNCoin
To create a simple e-wallet application using blockchain techniques for SSNcoin.

The project proves to be beneficial for user as it simplifies the process of monetary
transference to a great extent. Userâ€™s information is encoded and each transaction made
using the e-wallet creates a unique, one-time code, reducing security risks. It allows the user
to be more organized. Contactless payment makes the checkout process much faster. A
major part of the world of contactless payment and cryptography is blockchain and its
applications.

To execute this project, we created a smart contract. It is a self-executing contract
with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being written into direct
code.

To protect the privacy of students better, the details of the transaction can be made more
private. As it stands, blockchain is a transparent model. People can see who you are paying
and what amounts. SSNcoin is not designed to be private money but improvements can be
made to this.
